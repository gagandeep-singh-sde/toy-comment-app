## Assignment Report

The UI components are:

- Avatar: It composes of the name and picture of the user.
  > **Notes:**
  - The weight of avatar icon is heavier at the bottom because of which a padding of 1px is added to the bottom to make it look balanced.
  - The avatar also takes a Profile Picture prop which represents a real world implementation of such a component.
